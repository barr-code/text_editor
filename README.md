#Coffee Editor 
Rebuilding [Makers IDE text editor](https://github.com/makersacademy/makers-ide). Instead of JavaScript, though, I using CoffeeScript.

### Languages and Tools
```
  - CoffeeScript
  - Node.js
  - EJS
```

### How to Open
Clone this repository.
```
  $ git clone git@github.com:barr-code/text_editor.git
```
Change into the directory.
```
  $ cd text_editor
```

### Fire it Up
```
  $ coffee server.coffee
```
Go to the web address in your browser.
```
  http://localhost:3000
```
Edit some files!

### What I Learned
This was an exercise set by the coaches at Makers Academy to help familiarize us with CoffeeScript and give us some exposure
to Node.js. I later got a bit more experience with CoffeeScript in [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/Scully87/Coffee_Buzz) and Node.js (and associated tools) in my work
on a group building project, [TeaMakers](https://github.com/yvettecook/TeaMakers).
